An MCP server that lets AI explore your game structure, read/edit scripts, and perform bulk changes all locally and safely.

## Setup

2. Enable **Allow HTTP Requests** in Game Settings > Security
3. Connect your AI:

**Gemini:**
```bash
gemini mcp add robloxstudio npx --trust -- -y robloxstudio-mcp
```
